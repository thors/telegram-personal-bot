Hi!

I'm a bot. I only react on commands sent directly to me. All commands start with a &quot;/&quot;

Currently I know following commands:
<b>/help</b> - Display this help message
<b>/kfz $LETTER</b> - Show the origin of a plate number starting with $LETTER
<b>/fortune [$TOPIC]</b> - Print a fortune (joke or wise word). "fortune /list" gives a list of available topics.
